# Node Cellar - TypeScript
## A sample application made with TypeScript, Node.js, Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap, Express, and Sequelize

"Node Cellar" is a sample CRUD application built with with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize), and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).

This fork of the [original Node Cellar app](https://github.com/ccoenraets/nodecellar) updates the back-end from JavaScript to TypeScript and moves from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to Sequelize (with [sequelize-typescript](https://github.com/RobinBuschmann/sequelize-typescript)). Although the app is configured to use Postgres, it can easily be used with any database that Sequelize supports, such as MySQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).

The application allows you to browse through a list of wines, as well as add, update, and delete wines.

The original version of this application is documented [here](http://coenraets.org/blog).
